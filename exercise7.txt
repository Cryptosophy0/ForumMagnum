Here is a MongoDB query. Assume that most widgets are red and are not deleted,
and that there are a very large number of widgets in the database.
    Widgets.find({
      deleted: false,
      red: true,
    }).sort({
      createdAt: -1
    }).limit(10)

7. Which of these indexes suffice to make this query fast? For each, answer yes or no.
   7a. {createdAt:1}
   7b. {deleted:1, red:1, blue:1, createdAt:1}
   7c. {deleted:1, red:1, createdAt:1, blue:1}
   7d. {createdAt:1, deleted:1, red:1, blue:1}
   7e. {blue:1, createdAt:1, deleted:1, red:1}
