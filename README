# What's Lesswrong2?

Lesswrong2 is a clean-slate overhaul of the [lesswrong](http://lesswrong.com) discussion platform. We're hoping that it will replace the current site and become the discourse infrastructure for the rationality community.

The old lesswrong is [famously](http://www.telescopeapp.org/blog/using-telescope-as-a-reddit-alternative/) one of the only successful extensions of the reddit codebase (forked circa 2008). While reddit's code served us as a stable platform while our community was in its initial stages, it has become hard to extend because of its age, complexity and monolithic design.

Lesswrong2 on the other hand is based on [contemporary](http://vulcanjs.org/) [web](https://facebook.github.io/react/) [technologies](http://genomearchitect.github.io/) designed to make rapid development much easier. It solves the problems that caused the old codebase to stagnate by being written with tools that are meticulously well-documented. We hope that this will allow us to rapidly improve the site and bring it up to date with what tools for [creating](https://medium.com/) [intellectual](https://www.quora.com/) [progress](https://stackexchange.com/) look like in 2017.

# Technologies

Lesswrong2 is built on top of four major open-source libraries.

1. [Vulcan](http://vulcanjs.org/) is a framework for designing social applications like forums and news aggregators. We use it to handle many facets of the LW2 functionality such as data-loading, authentication and search.

2. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a user interface programming library developed by Facebook that lets us define interface elements declaratively in the form of components. We use it to define how to render and manage state for all parts of the site.

3. [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is a query language for the Mongo datastore. Vulcan mostly deals with GraphQL for us, but occasionally we use it to define APIs for accessing and mutating our data.

4. [Draft](https://draftjs.org/) is a framework developed by Facebook for creating text editors. The content and message editors on Lesswrong2 are implemented on top of Draft.

# Contributing

Despite being unstable and not yet at the stage where it can be operated by end users, Lesswrong2 is feature complete and ready for public development.

## Read the Docs

The best way to get familiar with our stack is to read the Vulcan and GraphQL documentation pages.
1. Read about [Vulcan's architecture](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/architecture.html)
2. Learn how to [customize and extend Vulcan](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/example-customization.html)
3. Understand [components and theming](http://nova-docs.telescopeapp.org/theming.html)
4. Understand [Vulcan's data layer](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/schemas.html)
5. Complete the [GraphQL tutorial](http://graphql.org/learn/)

## Understand the Package System

The Lesswong2 project uses "package" in two different and related ways. In a Vulcan application, each package is a _standalone feature_ which provides some functionality to the site, and can be toggled on or off. All of the features that come with Vulcan out-of-the-box are generally found in the `packages` directory.

In addition to the default Vulcan packages, we've extended the platform with our own packages which are stored in the `packages/lesswrong/lib` directory. All of the features that we've added to Vulcan in order to make it suitable for running lesswrong reside in this directory.

### Vulcan Packages
Vulcan packages have the following properties:

* They are conceptual (e.g. "posts", "votes"), rather than semantic (e.g. "homepage"), organization.
* The app works whether a given non-core package is toggled on or off. For example, if I disable upvoting functionality, the page should load as usual, except the posts will not have upvoting buttons.
* They can be toggled on/off by importing the package in the parent feature's "package.js" file.

Packages usually have a directory structure that looks like this:
```
.
├── package.js -- sets the package name and version, and defines the set of other packages imported by your package
└── lib -- the core functionality of your package
|   └── containers -- higher-order-components which give access to some data (e.g. the current user) in the props of a wrapped component
|       └── ...
|   ├── server -- contains routing information
|       └── ...
|   ├── collection.js -- GraphQL collection (e.g. Users or Posts) which is where all instances of your package's data model (e.g. User) will be accessible
|   ├── fragments.js -- some reusable GraphQL queries for convenience
|   ├── mutations.js -- GraphQL mutators for your collection (new, edit, remove)
|   ├── permissions.js -- permissions for accessing data from the GraphQL collection
|   ├── resolvers.js -- GraphQL resolvers for your collection (list, single, total)
|   ├── schema.js -- GraphQL schema for your package's feature (e.g. fields of a User)
|   └── server.js -- re-exports files in server/*
```
You'll notice some packages are missing some of the above or have additional files. Do not worry, this simply means the package does not require that functionality (e.g. some features don't define new data to store). Also, string searches for specific functions are your friend here.

## Development Tips
### Iteration
* Prefer `_.range(n).forEach(i => my_function())` over `for (var i=0; i<n; i++)...`
* If the body of a for loop performs a stateful action (i.e. modifies a variable outside the scope of the for body), use `forEach`. Else, use `map`.
* Use underscore.js when possible.

### Style guide

* [Syntax rules](https://github.com/Khan/style-guides/blob/master/style/javascript.md#syntax)
* [Comments and documentation](https://github.com/Khan/style-guides/blob/master/style/javascript.md#comments-and-documentation)
* [ES6 rules](https://github.com/Khan/style-guides/blob/master/style/javascript.md#es67-rules)

### Debugging

* Use google chrome. Its debugging tools are superior.
* Use 'debugger' in code. Then Ctrl+Shift+J on your open page, and you can interactively step through the breakpoint. You can also interact with variables in scope at each step using the console at the bottom.
* Use `console.warn(variable)` when you want to see the stacktrace of `variable`
* Add the [react dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) extension to chrome, and switch to the "React" tab after pressing Ctrl+Shift+J. You can see the react component tree. Once you click on a component in the tree, you will have access to it in the console as the variable `$r`. For example, you can check the props or state using `$r.props` or `$r.state`.
* If you think a previous commit broke your feature, use [git's builtin debugging tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git)
* If you fix a bug, **write a test for it**.
